## APInf Developer pages

From this site you'll find detailed information about our practices. 

## API development

Our platform contains multiple APIs. What ever can be done from GUI, you can do it with API. Currently we have following APIs: 
- Catalog API (link to APInf.io)
- Management API (link to APInf.io)
- Flow API (link to apinf.io)

### API Design Guide
We have defined set of rules for API development. Read them first. 


## UX development

## Automated testing

We use automated testing. This means that you start developing new features by defining test first.
