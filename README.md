## APInf Developer pages

From this site you'll find detailed information about our practices. 

## Set up local development version 
Start developing the platform by installing APInf platform. You can do this multiple ways. [Here's more detailed information](https://github.com/apinf/platform/blob/develop/INSTALL.md) how to do it. 


## API development

Our platform contains multiple APIs. What ever can be done from GUI, you can do it with API. Currently we have following APIs: 
- Catalog API (link to APInf.io)
- Management API (link to APInf.io)
- Flow API (link to apinf.io)

### API Design Guide
We have defined set of rules for API development. [Read them first.](https://apinf.gitbooks.io/api-guidelines/content/)


## UX development

## Automated testing

We use automated testing. This means that you start developing new features by defining test first.
