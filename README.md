## Platform development

### Understand what you are dealing with

### Contribution process

### Contributor License Agreement

### Issues

Easiest way to follow development is to look at issues in Waffle. Other option is to use Github issues list. 

For new issues we have template in Github which will guide you to fill in needed information. 

### Set up local development version 
Start developing the platform by installing APInf platform. You can do this multiple ways. [Here's more detailed information](https://github.com/apinf/platform/blob/develop/INSTALL.md) how to do it. 


## API development

Our platform contains multiple APIs. What ever can be done from GUI, you can do it with API. Currently we have following APIs: 
- Catalog API (link to APInf.io)
- Management API (link to APInf.io)
- Flow API (link to apinf.io)

### API Design Guide
We have defined set of rules for API development. 
- [Read API Design Guide first.](https://apinf.gitbooks.io/api-guidelines/content/)
- [Overall process is good to understand](https://apinf.gitbooks.io/api-guidelines/content/process.html)


## UX development

## Automated testing

We use automated testing. This means that you start developing new features by defining test first.
